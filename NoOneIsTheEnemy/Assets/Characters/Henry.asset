  - "As you hold up Henry's \"gift\" to try and determine what it might be, you are
    suddenly hit with an overwhelming, suffocating smell of flowers. It fills your
    lungs and doesn't leave, even as you drop to the ground in a violent coughing
    fit. The last thing you're aware of as you lose consciousness is Henry's maniacal
    laughter.\r\n\r\nYou never wake up."
